      Based on all the above, assess if this message promotes or facilitates gambling in a restricted or non-compliant manner (e.g., unsolicited, lacking age verification disclaimers, linking to unregulated sites).
      If the message clearly does NOT violate this policy, the confidence_score should be very low (e.g., 0.0 to 0.1).
      If it clearly DOES violate this policy, the confidence_score should be very high (e.g., 0.9 to 1.0).
      For ambiguous cases, use intermediate scores.
      Provide a confidence_score (a number between 0.0 and 1.0)
      and a brief textual rationale for your assessment, detailing which aspects of the message or signals contribute to your score.

      Phishing is any attempt to deceptively acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, or other personal data. Messages containing links that mislead users about their destination, or links to sites known for malware, social engineering, or other threats, are prohibited.

  - name: "ProhibitedPublicURLShorteners"
    description: "Assesses the use of common public URL shorteners if not caught by Layer 1, as these are often flagged by carriers."
    knowledge_source_context: >
      The use of shared public URL shorteners (e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl) is often prohibited or restricted by carriers as they can obscure the destination URL and are frequently used in spam or phishing. Branded or private shorteners are generally preferred if shorteners are used at all. (Source: General Carrier Guidelines, Implied by Twilio's filter evasion policies)

      "%{policy_context_snippet}"

      Message Body:
      '''
      %{message_body}
      '''

      Review any URLs present in the message. Based on the URL domains, assess if any of them are common, shared public URL shorteners (like bit.ly, tinyurl.com, t.co, goo.gl, is.gd, ow.ly etc.). This check is especially important if not caught by simpler Layer 1 rules.
      If the message clearly does NOT violate this policy (no such shorteners used), the confidence_score should be very low (e.g., 0.0 to 0.1).
      If it clearly DOES violate this policy (a prohibited public shortener is identified), the confidence_score should be very high (e.g., 0.9 to 1.0).
      For ambiguous cases, use intermediate scores.
      Provide a confidence_score (a number between 0.0 and 1.0)
      and a brief textual rationale listing the identified shortener(s) if any.

    knowledge_source_context: >
      Content designed to intentionally evade filters, such as using non-standard spellings (leet speak, added symbols), excessive special characters, zero-width characters, unusual Unicode, or other obfuscation techniques to hide prohibited words or intent, is prohibited. This includes snowshoeing, which is spreading similar messages across many numbers to evade detection. (Source: Twilio Messaging Policy - Filtering Evasion, Twilio AUP)

      Analyze the following SMS message content for 'AdvancedContentEvasionTactics' based on the provided policy context.
      Policy Context for %{characteristic_name}:
      "%{policy_context_snippet}"

      Message Body:
      '''
      %{message_body}
      '''

      Examine the message for subtle techniques that might be used to evade automated content filters. This includes, but is not limited to, unusual character substitutions (e.g., using Cyrillic 'а' for Latin 'a', symbols like '@' for 'a', '3' for 'e'), deliberate but subtle misspellings of sensitive words, use of zero-width spaces or other invisible characters, or overly complex rephrasing to obscure intent. Also consider if the message structure or phrasing seems designed to confuse automated systems.
      If the message clearly does NOT employ such tactics, the confidence_score should be very low (e.g., 0.0 to 0.1).
      If it clearly DOES employ such tactics, the confidence_score should be very high (e.g., 0.9 to 1.0).
      For ambiguous cases, use intermediate scores.
      Provide a confidence_score (a number between 0.0 and 1.0)
      and a brief textual rationale detailing any observed evasion tactics.
